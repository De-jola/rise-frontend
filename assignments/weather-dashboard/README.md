========================================================================== PROJECT DESCRIPTION ==================================================================================
This Project highlights creating executable scripts in the command line(CLI). I used Hyper Terminal for this project.
There are three executable files which would be expanded below

======= Weather Information =======
This section makes use of the API from "https://wttr.in/{CITY}?fromat=j1" to populate the extracted information table. User has to input whatever city they can think of in order to
get weather information on it. Please note that this API makes use of cities not countries or states or continents.
****What I learned****
In this section, i learned how to call from an API and handle connection errors and errors from invalid inputs.
****Problems I faced****
I had issues using "grep" to find the exact keys in the json file format. Turns out grep is very sensitive even to spaces.
****How i solved them****
I made use of available resources online to explain the errors i faced and brainstormed to solve it.
****How to Use****
run "./weather.sh" and follow the prompts. When asked to input a city, type in the city you wish to get weather data for. You would then be prompted to check for another city if you
wish to.
